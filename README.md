A simple app that displays different colours depending which switch is set to on. The entirety of this app was made with the help of an ebook titlted '__Intro to App Development with Swift__' by Apple. The gif below demostrates the working application. 

The purpose of this app was to better understand how Xcode works and how to use UI components that tie in with actions.
